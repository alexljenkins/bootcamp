"""
Building on the VG16 CNN pretrained model to classify new items.

Variables to play with:

include_top (True):
  - Whether or not to include the output layers for the model.
    You donâ€™t need these if you are fitting the model on your own problem.
weights ('imagenet'):
  - What weights to load. You can specify None to not load pre-trained weights
    if you are interested in training the model yourself from scratch.
input_tensor (None):
  - A new input layer if you intend to fit the model
    on new data of a different size.
input_shape (None): (224, 224, 3)
  - The size of images that the model is expected to
    take if you change the input layer.
pooling (None/'max'/'avg'):
  - The type of pooling to use when you are
    training a new set of output layers.
classes (1000):
  - The number of classes (e.g. size of output vector) for the model.
    (requires include_top = True, and no weights argument)
